# Consumer-Segmentation-Analysis

Overview:
This project, completed for AXANTEUSâ€”a market research agencyâ€”focuses on segmenting consumers based on purchase behavior and promotional responsiveness. Using a dataset of 600 consumer profiles, I applied clustering and predictive modeling techniques to understand brand loyalty, identify value-conscious consumers, and optimize promotional targeting.

Objectives:

Segment consumers based on purchasing patterns and motivation.

Predict brand loyalty using machine learning models.

Identify value-conscious consumers to guide targeted marketing.

Tools & Techniques:

R Programming: Data preprocessing, K-means clustering, Random Forest modeling, and data visualization.

Statistical Imputation: Handled missing/zero values in variables like education, affluence index, and household size.

Feature Engineering: Normalized continuous variables, created custom indicators (e.g., value-consciousness), and calculated derived metrics like average price, transactions per brand run, etc.

Analytical Process:

K-Means Clustering: Used to identify behavioral and promotional segments using purchase volume, brand runs, and product preferences. Elbow method and silhouette scores guided optimal cluster selection.

Predictive Modeling: Built Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to classify value-conscious consumers and predict brand loyalty (brand runs).

Feature Importance: Identified key predictors like affluence index, number of transactions, and brand-specific volume shares influencing purchase decisions.

Outcomes:

Discovered three distinct consumer segments with varying brand loyalty and value sensitivity.

Achieved high sensitivity (96.7%) in identifying value-conscious consumers using logistic regression.

Provided actionable insights to help AXANTEUS clients design cost-effective promotional strategies and loyalty programs.
